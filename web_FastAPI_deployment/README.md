# How To Build and Deploy a Machine Learning Model with FastAPI

Learning Project, Mai 2021

Based on:
- [blogpost](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-machine-learning-model-with-fastapi-64c505213857) by Dario Radecic 
- excellent [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)

## Getting Started With FastAPI

Get up a FastAPI as simple as that:

```Python
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI

# 1. Create the app object
app = FastAPI()

# 2. Index route, opens automatically on http://127.0.0.1:8000
@app.get("/")
def index():
    return {"message": "Hello, stranger"}


# 3. Route with a single parameter, returns the parameter within a message
#    Located at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/AnyNameHere
@app.get("/{name}")
def async get_name(name: str):  # async optional, check if applicable
    return {"message": f"Hello, {name}"}


# 4. Run the API with uvicorn
#    Will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

In development mode run it like this (the reload param re-runs the API after every change in the code):

```bash
uvicorn [filename]:[app_object] --reload
```

FastAPI requires **Pyhton 3.6+** and is best installed as such:

```bash
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn[standard]
```

### Good to know

- I run FastAPI with a [Uvicorn ASGI server](http://www.uvicorn.org/)
- FastAPI is based on standard Python 3.6 type declarations (thanks to Pydantic - that's why in the project code IrisSpecies is based on Pydantic's BaseModel class.)

## This Mini-Project

We use the the famous [Iris dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv) to train a super simple Random Forest Classifier and build a REST API that exposes the prediction for the flower species for new observations.

After running the API, you can test it manually on the documentation page:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Or  programatically:

```python
import requests 

new_measurement = {
    'sepal_length': 5.7,
    'sepal_width': 3.1,
    'petal_length': 4.9,
    'petal_width': 2.2
}

response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict', json=new_measurement)
print(response.content)
```

Or from a bash terminal:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "sepal_length": 0,
  "sepal_width": 0,
  "petal_length": 0,
  "petal_width": 0
}'
```


### Good to know

In the project we use the POST method, as itâ€™s considered better practice to send parameters in JSON rather than in URL (as in the demo sample above).
