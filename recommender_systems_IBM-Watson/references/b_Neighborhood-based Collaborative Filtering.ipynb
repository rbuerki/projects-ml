    "# Recommendations with MovieTweetings: Neighborhood Collab Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **neighborhood-based collaborative filtering**. (However, it is easy to extend this approach to make recommendations using item-based collaborative filtering (see next notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering is one of the most popular methods for making recommendations, using the collaboration of user-item recommendations to assist in making new recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally there are two main methods of performing collaborative filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering**, which is based on the idea that we can either correlate items that are similar to provide recommendations or we can correlate users to one another to provide recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Based Collaborative Filtering**, which is based on the idea that we can use machine learning and other mathematical models to understand the relationships that exist amongst items and users to predict ratings and provide ratings (see SVD notebooks).\n"

If some measures are on a 5 point scale, while others are on a 100 point scale, you are likely to have non-optimal results due to the difference in variability of your features.  In this case, we will not need to scale data because they are all on a 10 point scale, but it is always something to keep in mind!"
