# Recommendations for IBM Watson Studio
In this project recommendations are made on articles from the IBM Watson Studio platform. This is a guided project with different sections that are independent to some degree. The result won't be a complete recommender system. (For a complete recommender class object see  `references` section.)

Highlights:
- different approaches to make recommendations
- extensive `references` section with a couple of notebooks from Udacity's DSND course.


### Introduction to the project and methodology

Sections of the project:

I. Exploratory Data Analysis
II. Rank Based Recommendations
III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
IV. Content Based Recommendations (with NLP)
V. Matrix Factorization (FunkSVD)
VI. Conclusion

This project was completed as part of the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). Code templates and data were provided by Udacity. 

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [sklearn](scikit-learn.org/)
- [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/)

### Code / Files

- `1-recommendations for IBM Watson Studio.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all the relevant code
- `2-additional exploration for NLP content-based.ipynb`: Some EDA and NLP experimentation on the content data. The results were then used in the "Content Based" section of the main notebook.
- `projects_test.py`: A file containing some tests from Udacity to check if the different sections were performed successfully.

`References`section has it's own README.
