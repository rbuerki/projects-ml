Now that we only have 2 latent features, we might measure how well we are able to reproduce the original matrix by looking at the sum of squared errors from each rating produced by taking the dot product as compared to the actual rating.

    "Let's take a step back for a second.  In this example we just went through, your matrix was very clean.  That is, for every user-movie combination, we had a rating.  **There were no missing values.** But what we know from the previous lesson is that the user-movie matrix is full of missing values.  \n",

Furthermore, if we use these \"noisey\" latent features to assist in re-constructing the original user-movie matrix it will potentially (and likely) lead to worse ratings than if we only have latent features associated with signal."
