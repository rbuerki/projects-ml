## Unsupervised Learning - Ressources

These notebooks were part of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. They were used to practice different forms of 
unsupervised learning

### Overview

1) **k-means Clustering of Movie Ratings**
    - (the most extensive notebook in this section by far - a small project on it's own)
    - explains k-means, shows how to assess number of k with ellbow method / silhouette score
    - shows how clustering can be used togehter with collaborative filtering to make recommendations

2) **GMM vs K-means on Iris Dataset (Gaussian Mixture Models)**
    - shows how to use Gaussian Mixture Model clustering
    - shows how to evaluate clustering algorithms with adjusted Rand score (ARI)

3) **Hierarchical Clustering of Iris Dataset**
    - explains hierarchical clustering with different parameters and visualization possibilities
    - shows importance of preprocessing (normalization)

4) **DBSCAN Showcase (density based clustering)**
    - shows how to tweak DBSCAN parameters depending on dataset properties / data distribution

5) **ICA on WAV-Files (dimensionality reduction with Independent Component Analysis)**
    - shows how to apply ICA to separate different signals in an audio mix

6) **PCA for face recognition with SVM (dimensionality reduction using eigenfaces)**
    - shows how to apply PCA for face recognition with SVM, using eigenfaces


### Install

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
