# Recommendations for IBM Watson Studio
In this project the recommendation skills learened in the references section (see that folder) are put to use on some data from the IBM Watson Studio platform. This is a guided project with different sections that are independent to some degree. The result won't be a complete recommender system. (For a complete recommender class object, see references section.)


### Introduction to the project and methodology

Sections of the project:

I. Exploratory Data Analysis
II. Rank Based Recommendations
III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
IV. Content Based Recommendations (with NLP)
V. Matrix Factorization (FunkSVD)
VI. Conclusion

This project was completed as part of the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). Code templates and data were provided by Udacity. The data was originally sourced by Udacity from Figure Eight.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [sklearn](scikit-learn.org/)
- [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/)

### Code / Files

- `1-recommendations for IBM Watson Studio.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all the relevant code
- `2-additional exploration for NLP content-based.ipynb`: Some EDA and NLP experimentation on the content data. The results were then used in the "Content Based" section of the main notebook.
- `projects_test.py`: A file containing some tests from Udacity to check if the different sections were performed successfully.

`References`section has it's own README.
