# Reference Material for Reccommender Systems

All notebooks here have been completed during [Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). They are meant as introduction to the different basic types of recommender systems.

There are two main sections:
- different basic approaches: notebooks a-d
- model based approach with FunkSVD that is mixed with content-based recommendations: notebooks 1-4

There is also a folder containing a complete  `Recommender` class, in which the code of the the model based section is put together in one place.
