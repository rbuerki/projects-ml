# Housing Price Prediction

 Supervised regression modelling to predict house prices. Comparision of ElasticNet and XGBoost. The focus of this project is on finding the right feature preprocessing and most of all on inspecting feature importances (among others with eli5 library).

### Introduction to project and results

The focus of this project is on finding the right feature preprocessing (for ElasticNet) using CV in Pipelines and most of all on inspecting and comparing feature importances for both models (among others with eli5 library).

Results: Both model have a similar r2-Score of roughly 0.9. Comparing the 15 most important features for both models we can see that only 7 of them are matching. That is quite a surprise. We can also see that using feature importance for feature selection prior to model fitting can lead to an increase in performance (see last section of notebook 4).

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](http://seaborn.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
- [eli5](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Code

There are four numbered notebooks with self-explaining titels (at least that's what I hope).

### Data

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. Here's a brief version of what you'll find in the data description file (see `data` folder):
